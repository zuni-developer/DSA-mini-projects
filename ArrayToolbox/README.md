# ArrayToolbox - Fixed Size Array DSA Project

## 📌 Project Overview

**ArrayToolbox** is a beginner-friendly **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** project implemented in Python. It demonstrates how a **fixed-size array** works under the hood and allows users to perform various DSA operations interactively via a console-based interface.

The core logic revolves around implementing standard array operations and basic algorithms like **Bubble Sort** and **Binary Search**, making it a great hands-on project for understanding how arrays are managed in low-level data structures.

## 🧠 DSA Concepts Covered

- 📦 Fixed-size arrays
- ✏️ Insertion and Deletion at specific indices
- 🔍 Linear and Binary Search
- 🔄 Bubble Sort algorithm
- ✅ Boundary checking (is_full, is_empty)
- 🧹 Clearing arrays
- 📈 Array resizing (manual doubling)

## 🛠 Features

- Insert a value at a specific index  
- Delete a value from a specific index  
- Update value at an index  
- Get a value at an index  
- Display and print array contents  
- Linear search for any element  
- Check if array is full or empty  
- Clear all elements  
- Sort array using Bubble Sort  
- Perform Binary Search after sorting

## 📂 File Structure

- `main.py`: Interactive menu for user input and array operation selection
- `fixed_array_template.py`: Contains the `FixedSizeArray` class implementing all DSA operations
