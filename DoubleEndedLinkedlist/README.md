ðŸ”— DoubleEndedLinkedListToolbox

A Python module implementing a double-ended linked list, allowing insertions and deletions from both ends, sorted insertion, and traversal.

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project is part of my DSA toolbox collection, built to understand and practice classic data structures by implementing them from scratch.

Features:

Insert at front and back

Remove from front and back

Insert while keeping the list sorted

Search and get element by index

Traverse and print the list

Track list size internally

ðŸ§ª Test Cases

Includes test cases covering:

Edge cases (empty list, single element)

Insertions/removals from both ends

Sorted insert correctness

Index-based retrieval and search operations

Run the test file to validate functionality:

python test_cases.py
